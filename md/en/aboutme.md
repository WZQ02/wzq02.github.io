# About me

**A random guy trying things.**

You might be wondering why I didn't wrote a self-introduction on this website... Well, I honestly don't know how to appropriately introduce myself.

Anyway,

My name is WZQ, I mean literally. The "'02" is actually my birth year. Why am I exposing these personal information in my screen name? Actually I don't know. I named myself on Internet like that since about 10 years ago, and I don't feel like changing it to something else. Let's just say I'm bad at naming things, even for myself.

You may already knew I hate to put tags on me. So if I have to tag me with one word......**"content creator"**, that is. I mean, making otoMADs, writing text and website designing......It's all "content creation", right?

That's all I can think of for now. I might be adding some other stuff here later on.
