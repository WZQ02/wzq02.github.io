![I was basically saying that I need to write long posts to express myself better.](https://img.wzq02.top/upl/b0780a981efe06694866c5a5913a3a49.png)

Recently, I feel that my ability to express myself in language has deteriorated again, so I plan to write some articles occasionally to practice.

There is a saying: many things that seem very beautiful and positive on the surface, if you think about them carefully, you might realize that there are some rather disturbing aspects hidden behind them.

Take illustrators as an example. Normally, when we see those cute and beautiful illustrations, as viewers, we generally don't think too much about them. But in fact, if illustration is considered as a profession, it is actually a very competitive industry. Or to say, any industry that doesnâ€™t have a high barrier to entry and has a large number of people participating in it is bound to be like this. Especially in many ACG (Anime, Comics, and Games) related content creation fields, such as MADs, PVs, art tracks, etc., most of the creators' works actually lack depth and are not very sophisticated. Many creators are essentially doing a dressed-up version of manual labor. Most of the flashy PVs you see on video websites (of course, not all works) don't require much thought behind them, but rather, a lot of effort in production.

This in itself is not a problem, because most viewers don't necessarily need something "sophisticated". As long as the produced content has enough form, that's enough. The problem arises when you intend to make a career out of this kind of thing. You will find that competition in this market is very tough, because there are too many people, both domestically and internationally (especially overseas), who are energetic and willing to spend time and effort on content production. Especially in Japan, authors in fields like PVs, music, and illustrations are almost flooding the market. But as I said earlier, most of the production work is essentially manual labor, so most works are relatively homogenized in terms of content.

But do you know what is best at doing this kind of "manual labor"? AI. The development speed of AI now cannot be ignored. From the AI drawing tools that became popular at the end of the year before last, to the recently viral suno.ai, all are proving this point. Of course, the works produced by these AIs are far from perfect, but with the current speed of technological development, in another year or two, the works of most creators will no longer have any advantage (at least from a commercial perspective) in front of AI mass production. Therefore, many content creation fields related to ACG, and even to a larger extent, the entire content creation industry, including computer-related fields with a relatively low barrier to entry like web frontend, I am not optimistic about these as professions. For current content creation, unless you can really do something incredible and unique, I think it's better just to treat it as a hobby.

Actually, similar views have been expressed by many people before. Take otoMADs, which are closer to us, for example. The homogenization phenomenon in domestic otoMADs may not be much better than in other fields, but the good thing about China's otoMAD community is that it's relatively small and not so commercialized, or at least it doesn't exist solely for commercial purposes. Therefore, the impact of AI on the domestic otoMAD circle will not be so severe. But just like AI-generated illustrations and music, people will get tired and fed up with a large output of homogenized works. Fortunately, the otoMAD community is no longer dominated by the "technology-first" mindset as it used to be. More and more works that shine from different perspectives are emerging, and both authors and audiences are adopting more diverse criteria for judging works, which is a good thing, I guess.

By the way, since I don't feel like posting this kind of stuff on public platforms like Bilibili, but I do want to hear different opinions, so please leave your comments down there if you like.
