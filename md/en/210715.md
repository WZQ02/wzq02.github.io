# Notes

So... Back in July 2020, I've created a blog site on GitHub pages using Hexo, back then I decided to use that blog site as my personal webpage. However in the middle of 2021, I rent a private server and then decided to host a website on it, which then becomes my personal webpage. This was also the time when I began to learn stuff about web design (HTML, CSS, JS and etc.), I was mostly inspired by [Sakuranomiya Aira](https://otomad.wiki/User:%E8%89%BE%E4%BA%86%E4%B8%AA%E6%8B%89) back then, she basically did an overhaul on the MediaWiki user interface (with CSS), and I thought that was pretty cool.

Now the GitHub blog site is not used anymore.
