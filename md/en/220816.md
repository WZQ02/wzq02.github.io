# How to download YouTube videos with youtube-dl (for Windows users)

Since I've seen some people on QQ had problems using youtube-dl, I decided to write this tutorial.

1. ~~Go to youtube-dl's [GitHub page](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)~~ (actually don't do that, download [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) instead), Find the releases tag on the right and click it.

2. Find the executable file youtube-dl.exe down there, and download it.

3. Create a folder in anywhere on your PC, then move the exe file in the folder.

4. Now, open up the advanced settings panel. Right click "This PC" or "My Computer" icon, choose "Properties", and then go to "Advanced System Settings".

![Depending on what version of Windows you are using, the "Advanced System Settings" option could be there](https://wzq02.top/images/for_hexo/20220816/4.png)

5. Then you need to follow the steps in the picture to create an entry in the "Path" environment variable. Input the absolute location of that folder you've created, and hit "OK" to save your settings.

![Type in the absolute location, like C:\111](https://wzq02.top/images/for_hexo/20220816/6.png)

6. Now, open up the folder you want to download the video to, hold the Shift key and right click on the blank area, select "Open Command Prompt Here" or "Open Powershell Window Here". (If you are using Windows 11 or you've installed Windows Terminal before, you won't need to hold the Shift key, just right click and select "Open in Terminal")

7. Then in the newly opened window, type in ```youtube-dl [the url of the video]```, hit Enter and the video download will begin.

8. Now you might find out that you've downloaded the video and audio seperately, or the video is in low quality, that's because youtube-dl needs FFmpeg to merge video correctly. If you didn't install it, you might encounter this.

9. [Go to here](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-full.7z) to download the latest version of FFmpeg, then open the archive file, find ffmpeg.exe, ffplay.exe, ffprobe.exe in the bin folder, extract ffmpeg.exe in to the folder you've just created.

10. Close the command prompt window you've opened and redo step 6-7, you should be able to download high quality videos now.

11. Since YouTube limits download speed of third-party software since the end of 2021, youtube-dl might be very slow or unable to download videos, so I recommend you to use [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) instead. The installation process is pretty much the same as youtube-dl.

That's about it.
