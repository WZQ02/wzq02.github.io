# Easter Eggs of wzq02.top

For now this website had existed for over 2 years. As time went by, I had added more and more features to this site, even though it won't have many visiters. Some of those features are rather obvious, like you can scroll down (with mouse wheel or touchscreen) to see my blogposts, along with some other web apps I added to this site, while some of them aren't. In this article, I'll be covering some of the hidden features I've added to this site at the time being.

## Custom Background

## Video Background

## Clickable Avatars

## Click Speed Statistics

## Short Link

## acg.tv Replacement

## Single Page Version

## Built-in Reader and Hidden Articles

## Standalone Markdown Reader

## F12 Functions

## GitHub Mirror Site

## Hidden Demos

## CSS Fonts

and even more...

You know what, I'll just leave what's up there with only titles and no descriptions, nobody is gonna see this article anyway. Fuck it.
